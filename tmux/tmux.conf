# Aggressive Resize
# (from http://mutelight.org/articles/practical-tmux)
#
# By default, all windows in a session are constrained to the size of the
# smallest client connected to that session, even if both clients are looking
# at different windows. It seems that in this particular case, Screen has the
# better default where a window is only constrained in size if a smaller client
# is actively looking at it. This behaviour can be fixed by setting tmux's
# aggressive-resize option.
setw -g aggressive-resize on

# When using LunarVim in tmux, when hitting "ESC" then "j" or "k" under default
# tmux config, it will MOVE the current line down/up one line respectively; not cool!
# Bug detailed here:
#   https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim/issues/1857
# This fixes it:

# Some Vim integration.
#
# The following did not work. Not sure why. Gotta get back to work.
#
        ### EXPERIMENTAL - I setup cmd-ctrl-[ and -] in iTerm to send hex codes
        ### <prefix>p and <prefix>n to tmux to allow 'one key' pane switching.
        ### Unfortunately, if I do this accidentailly while *not* in tmux but *in* vim,
        ### it sends a ctrl-a following by a p or n, which 'does stuff' in vim (e.g.
        ### pasting.
        ### So!
        ### I could just do this:
        ###            noremap <C-a>p <Nop>
        ###            noremap <C-a>n <Nop>
        ### to turn off ctrl-a p and ctrl-a n in vim, but that 'slows down' ctrl-a (by
        ### making it wait for 'timeout'), and I think I want to keep ctrl-a. Instead,
        ### ctrl-@ seems much less used, I think I can live without it.  See in
        ### particular https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Unused_keys
        ### So! I will 1) make <C-@> the prefix2 in tmux, 2) I will map C-@ p and n to
        ### prev and next-window, 3) I will have iTerm send the hex codes for <C-@>p or n
        ### when I push cmd-ctrl-[ or -], and 4) I will map <C-@>p and n to NOOPs.
        ##set-option -g prefix2 C-@
        ##bind -T prefix2 p previous-window
        ##bind -T prefix2 n next-window
