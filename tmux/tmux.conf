# Note: Use screen-256color instead of tmux-256color, as the latter causes
# 'less' to spit out this error:
#       WARNING: terminal is not fully functional
# and then asks you to his ESC to continue.

# Aggressive Resize
# (from http://mutelight.org/articles/practical-tmux)
#
# By default, all windows in a session are constrained to the size of the
# smallest client connected to that session, even if both clients are looking
# at different windows. It seems that in this particular case, Screen has the
# better default where a window is only constrained in size if a smaller client
# is actively looking at it. This behaviour can be fixed by setting tmux's
# aggressive-resize option.
