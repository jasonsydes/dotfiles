# No matter what system we're on, /etc/profile gets read when starting a login
# shell. Unfotunately, login shells are started for Tmux. This has the unfortunate
# consequence of moving the miniconda path from the front of PATH (where it
# belongs) to the rear of PATH.  Then the wrong vim gets read, and I can no
# longer use my conda vim under Tmux.

# Since we alter /etc/profile on some systems, we "fix" this problem with a hack:
# Simply reset the PATH to nothing, then manually source /etc/profile.

# Background:
#       https://superuser.com/a/970847 - Tmux *should* start a login shell, even though it causes the problem described above.


# Looks like we maybe need to source /etc/environment first (which is apparently how rayfin sets up PATH??)
PATH=""
if [ -f /etc/environment ]; then
    source /etc/environment
fi
if [ -f /etc/profile ]; then
    source /etc/profile
fi

# Finally, this fixes conda in tmux:
if [[ `type conda 2>/dev/null` ]] ; then
    [[ -z $TMUX ]] || conda deactivate; conda activate base
fi
