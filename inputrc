# Bracketed paste mode: prevents pasted text from auto-executing.
# Protects against "paste attacks" when copying commands from the web, docs,
# Slack, Stack Overflow, or other untrusted sources. Malicious sites can hide
# dangerous commands (rm -rf, curl|bash, etc.) in innocent-looking snippets,
# or embed hidden newlines that execute before you can review.
#
# How it works — three layers cooperate:
#   1. The terminal emulator (Ghostty, iTerm2, etc.) wraps pasted text in
#      escape sequences: \e[200~ <pasted text> \e[201~
#   2. tmux passes those escape sequences through to the program inside.
#   3. readline (here, via inputrc) interprets the sequences and holds the
#      pasted text for review instead of executing it immediately.
# The terminal is the transport, readline is the gatekeeper. Without
# readline's support, the escape sequences are ignored and pasted text
# executes as if typed.
#
# Note: bash 5.1+ (readline 8.1+) enables this by default. This line is
# redundant on modern bash but still useful for older versions or as
# explicit documentation of intent.

# Rename this file to be ~/.inputrc for fun and profit.

# To reload after editing: Ctrl+x Ctrl+r (or log out and back in).
# This is a readline command - readline is the line-editing library that bash
# uses under the hood. Other programs that use readline (python REPL, gdb,
# psql, etc.) will also pick up these settings in that terminal session.

# Type partial command, then hit arrow-UP or arrow-DOWN multiple times.
# It's a way of limiting the searching of your history to just history items
# prefixed with your partial command.

# Ignore case during tab completion.
# If you're trying to tab complete on, say, DOWNLOADS, then you can
# type 'dow' and then TAB, and it will tab complete to DOWNLOADS.
set completion-ignore-case on

# Example:
#   Say you type the following:
#       ls -al some_file
#       cp !$ !$.bak
#   That is equivalent to:
#       ls -al some_file
#       cp !$ !$.bak
#   Sometimes though, it is scary to hit ENTER with those strange characters...
#   So use Magic Space!
#   After you type in '!$' (but before hitting ENTER) hit the SPACE button and
#   the '!$' will be replaced with its value.
# From many places, here's one:

$if Bash
  Space: magic-space
