# Type partial command, then hit arrow-UP or arrow-DOWN multiple times.
# It's a way of limiting the searching of your history to just history items
# prefixed with your partial command.

# Ignore case during tab completion.
# If you're trying to tab complete on, say, DOWNLOADS, then you can
# type 'dow' and then TAB, and it will tab complete to DOWNLOADS.
set completion-ignore-case on

# Example:
#   Say you type the following:
#       ls -al some_file
#       cp !$ !$.bak
#   That is equivalent to:
#       ls -al some_file
#       cp !$ !$.bak
#   Sometimes though, it is scary to hit ENTER with those strange characters...
#   So use Magic Space!
#   After you type in '!$' (but before hitting ENTER) hit the SPACE button and
#   the '!$' will be replaced with its value.
# From many places, here's one:
