# Take an existing (non-symlinked) lvim config (generally after a fresh install)
# and convert it into a symlinked lvim config.

# Usage:
#   store-exisiting-lvim-config.sh NAME
# Example:
#   store-exisiting-lvim-config.sh lvim-basic-ide
# Above example will result in SYMLINKS that look like this: 
#           INCOMPLETE
#   ~/.config/lvim              -> ~/.config/lvim--lvim-basic-ide
#   ~/.cache/lvim               -> ~/.cache/lvim--lvim-basic-ide
#   ~/.local/state/lvim         -> ~/.local/state/lvim--lvim-basic-ide
#   ~/.local/share/lunarvim     -> ~/.local/share/lunarvim--lvim-basic-ide
#   ~/.local/bin/lvim           -> ~/.local/bin/lvim--lvim-basic-ide
