You must build neovim from source on Talapas (and longreads).

(Using the binary distribution results in GLIBC_X.XX something or other not found.)

## Build

This was the build environment that worked.
I think actually gxx wasn't needed for the build (lvim startup, maybe treesitter, complained until I added gxx).
Everything else though, was present during the build.

        âˆ´ conda env export --from-history
        name: lunarvim-play8
        channels:
          - conda-forge
          - bioconda
          - defaults
        dependencies:
          - python
          - rust
          - nodejs
          - fd-find
          - ripgrep
          - pynvim
          - msgpack-python
          - greenlet
          - gcc
          - cmake
          - lua
          - ca-certificates
          - openssl
          - git
          - gxx
        prefix: /home/sydes/miniconda3/envs/lunarvim-play8

Commands used to build:

    make -j100 CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/opt
    make install


Also, see my "bug" report:
    https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim/issues/3705
    Basically, don't move the nvim binary out of place, otherwise bootstrapping won't work.
        This is true for both a) using Release binary, and b) building from source.

## Run environment

conda activate base
mamba install python rust nodejs fd-find ripgrep pynvim msgpack-python greenlet     gxx lua

4. Install LunarVim according to their instructions. At time of writing, this was:
    LV_BRANCH='release-1.2/neovim-0.8' bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lunarvim/lunarvim/fc6873809934917b470bff1b072171879899a36b/utils/installer/install.sh)
    But this will change for each release.

5. During install, 
    * say "yes" to the nodejs dependencies (they will install in your conda env)
    * say "no" to both python and rust deps (they are installed as conda packages, see the mamba create command above).

6. Set PATH
    export PATH=~/opt/bin:$PATH

7. Type "lvim" to run LunarVim for the first time.
    (It needs to do some tree-sitter installs for a minute, then it's ready to go.

Then head over and do ~/.dotfiles/nvim-lvim-common/setup.sh .
