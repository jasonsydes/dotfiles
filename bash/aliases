# For "long" running commands, like "ls -alrt" or "sort", it's nice to be able to
# see both the head and tail, but not have to run the command twice to do so, eg
# like so:
#       ls -alrt | head
#       ls -alrt | tail
# You can do so like this: 
#       ls -alrt | (head;tail)
# This is an alias to allow that quickly:
#       ls -alrt | ht
alias ht="(head;tail)"
