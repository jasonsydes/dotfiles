    # Bash's operate-and-get-next is bound to C-o.
    # Unfortunately, C-o is evidently mapped to the discard character on most ttys.
    # (So this is a problem with readline I guess.)
    # Anyway, the following fixes it, and you can use awesome C-o.
    # Not sure if this problem exists on other platforms.

## History
# I've been having the problem (for several years now) where my bash_history
# somehow gets overwritten. Then I have to restore it, I have to keep backups...
# I hate it! My previous setup is just below here (see "Infinite history - PREVIOUSLY" below).
# So, maybe if I goose some settings here, that phenotype will disappear. Crossing fingers.
# See also https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/48113
