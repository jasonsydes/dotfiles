    # In general, don't share, but leave your home directory viewable in case you do want to share.

    # Changing to now be the following:
    #       1. Your home directory is 750, which means all my files are not visible
    #          to anyone (right??).
    #       2. Pete can see my files (we're in same PI group....)
    #       3. When I build stuff in /projects/eb, I want everything to be
    #          visible (and writable) by swmgr, but only visible and not
    #          writable by everyone.
    # umask 0002
