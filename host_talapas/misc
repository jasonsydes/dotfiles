    # Changing to now be the following:
    #       1. Your home directory is 750, which means all my files are not visible
    #          to anyone (right??).
    #       2. Pete can see my files (we're in same PI group....)

    #          visible (and writable) by swmgr, but only visible and not
    #          writable by everyone.
