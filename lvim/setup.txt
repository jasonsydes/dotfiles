First perform ~/.dotfiles/nvim/setup.sh, which does steps 1 and 2 below.
Then come back here, starting at step 3.

See my "bug" report:
https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim/issues/3705

Basically, don't move the nvim binary out of place, otherwise bootstrapping won't work.
    This is true for both a) using Release binary, and b) building from source.

1. Get neovim somehow (Release binary or from source)
    a. By binary, you just download from github page, and untar it somewhere.
    b. By building by source:
        git clone the neovim github repo
        cd neovim
        make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/opt
        make install
2. Point PATH at that neovim installation, eg:
    # binary release example:
    export PATH=~/src/nvim-macos/bin:$PATH
    # building from source example:
    export PATH=~/opt/bin:$PATH
3. Prep environ like so:
    mamba create -n lunarvim-play777 python=3.10 rust nodejs fd-find ripgrep pynvim msgpack-python greenlet
4. Install LunarVim according to their instructions. At time of writing, this was:
    LV_BRANCH='release-1.2/neovim-0.8' bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lunarvim/lunarvim/master/utils/installer/install.sh)
5. During install, 
    * say "yes" to the nodejs dependencies (they will install in your conda env)
    * say "no" to both python and rust deps (they are installed as conda packages, see the mamba create command above).
6. Type "lvim" to run LunarVim for the first time.
    (It needs to do some tree-sitter installs for a minute, then it's ready to go.

Then head over and do ~/.dotfiles/nvim-lvim-common/setup.sh .
