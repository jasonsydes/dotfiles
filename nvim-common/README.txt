Put stuff here that is "common" to all neovim installations (e.g. vanilla nvim, lunarvim, etc)
You will likely ditch this at some point (and just do your own config).

Put stuff that is "specific" to a given install in the dedicated folders (eg ~/.dotfiles/nvim, ~/.dotfiles/lvim, etc)

"Common" and "Specific" are rather arbitrarily defined by me, whatever mood I'm in that day. So there.
