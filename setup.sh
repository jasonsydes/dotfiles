# Ok!  Some Karabiner-Elements remapping of keys.
#   Inspired by https://stackoverflow.com/a/28526956 (which points to an older now/defunct version of Karabiner).
#       That post suggests (roughly) the following (Karabiner can now handle all changes:
#           Use Karabiner to:
#               Send Esc when you type Control by itself.
#                   You need to import from their web page the following:
#                       "Post escape if left_control is pressed alone."
#               Send Esc when you press Caps Lock alone:
#                   Import the following from webpage:
#                       "Change caps_lock to control if pressed with other keys, to escape if pressed alone."
#
# I might also love:
#       CAPS LOCK + hjkl to arrow keys
#
# Looks like you can't choose everything.  I think they following two conflict (it choose one, but not both):
#       CAPS LOCK + hjkl to arrow keys
#       Change caps_lock to control if pressed with other keys, to escape if pressed alone.
# Still, I got LOTS of options!
# Karabiner ROCKS.
