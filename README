My dotfiles setup.

Don't try to actually run any of the scripts such as "setup.sh" or "install.sh"
without understanding what is in them.  Running those scripts may BREAK your
setup. I did not write those "scripts" for the public, I wrote them for me.
Running those "scripts" may BREAK your setup.  You've been warned.

******************************************************************************
***** As always, the best advice is to never put anything in any of your *****
***** dotfiles (e.g. .bashrc, .vimrc, etc) that you don't understand.    *****
******************************************************************************

See my "notes" in the various 'setup.sh' and 'install.sh' files.

I'm publishing this mostly so I can give URLs to specific dotfiles to students,
colleagues and friends.

Currently my symlinks look like this:

.bash_profile -> .dotfiles/bash/bash_profile
.bashrc -> .dotfiles/bash/bashrc
.nvimrc -> .vimrc
.tmux.conf -> .dotfiles/tmux/tmux.conf
.vimrc -> .dotfiles/vim/vimrc
