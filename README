This is just my dotfiles setup.  Don't try to actually run any of the scripts
such as "setup.sh" or "install.sh" without understanding what is in them.
Running those scripts may BREAK your setup. I did not write those "scripts" for
the public, I wrote them for me. Running those "scripts" may BREAK your setup.
You've been warned.

See my "notes" in the various 'setup.sh' and 'install.sh' files.

I'm publishing this mostly so I can give URLs to friends, colleagues, students
to specific config files.
