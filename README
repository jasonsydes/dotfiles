My dotfiles setup.

Don't try to actually run any of the scripts such as "setup.sh" or "install.sh"
without understanding what is in them.  Running those scripts may BREAK your
setup. I did not write those "scripts" for the public, I wrote them for me.
Running those "scripts" may BREAK your setup.  You've been warned.

See my "notes" in the various 'setup.sh' and 'install.sh' files.
