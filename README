My dotfiles setup.

Don't try to actually run any of the scripts such as "setup.sh" or "install.sh"
without understanding what is in them.  Running those scripts may BREAK your
setup. I did not write those "scripts" for the public, I wrote them for me.
Running those "scripts" may BREAK your setup.  You've been warned.

There are many different ways to manage your dotfiles, and thousands of
examples on the internet.  Nothing fancy in this repo, it only has what I need.

See my "notes" in the various 'setup.sh' and 'install.sh' files.

I'm publishing this mostly so I can give URLs to specific dotfiles to students,
colleagues and friends.

Currently my symlinks look like this:

.bash_profile -> .dotfiles/bash/bash_profile
.bashrc -> .dotfiles/bash/bashrc
.nvimrc -> .vimrc
.tmux.conf -> .dotfiles/tmux/tmux.conf
.vimrc -> .dotfiles/vim/vimrc
