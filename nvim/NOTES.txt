### Neovim puts stuff in multiple different places (AKA to start from scratch, delete all this stuff...)
- ~/.config/nvim/init.vim               - the config file
- ~/.local/state/nvim/                  - backup, undo
- ~/.local/share/nvim/                  - the data dir, swap, includes plugins, autoload
- ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer - this is for Packer, which is 
- ~/.cache/nvim                         - yup, stuff goes in here as well.

NO LONGER APPLICABLE:
    I'm currently getting an error on line 7 of kickstart.nvim's init.lua.
    But the look is wrong...
        But I can't copy the error. This post suggests using the Trouble.nvim plugin for better experience:
