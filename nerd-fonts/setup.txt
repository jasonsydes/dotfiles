I followed this:
    https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#option-2-release-archive-download
Which says:
    Option 2: Release Archive Download
        Best option if you want an archive or complete font family of variations (Bold, Italic, etc.).
    Fonts are available for download as packages in the latest release
So, I went here:
    https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/tag/v2.2.2
And downloaded 
    https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.2.2/Inconsolata.zip
Unzipped it, then installed all the *.otf non-windows fonts on my mac.
    - Prefer otf over ttf if available, otherwise ttf is fine.
    - To install on mac, just double-click on the file 
        (eg Inconsolata Bold Nerd Font Complete Mono.otf) which brings
        up the Font Book app, then click on its "Install Font" button.
And then enable it iTerm, like so:
    Preferences > Profiles > Pick the appropriate Profile > Text > Font > Choose Inconsolata
        Note: I also had to set the horizontal space to 80 (it should be right there, looks like "v|i")

Someone said that "Fantasque Sans Mono" looks great. Let's try that.
