NerdFonts come from here:
    https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts
Here's their description as of Oct 2022:
    Nerd Fonts is a project that patches developer targeted fonts with a high
    number of glyphs (icons). Specifically to add a high number of extra glyphs
    from popular 'iconic fonts' such as Font Awesome, Devicons, Octicons, and
    others.
Think Powerline, Font Awesome, etc. They basically allow you to have cool looking
tmux, zellij, vim status lines (among other things).

I'm using it here initially for zellij, but plenty of environments use these.

See "setup.txt" in this folder for how to manually install these.
